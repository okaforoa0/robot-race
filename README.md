# robot-race
This code was created for my Microprocessor Systems class where we had a robot race. 

***************************************************************************************************************
- Incorporated servo motors to move a battery powered/autonomous robot
- Used 4 IR sensors to enable robot to follow the line/course (followed a black stripe on a white
 background, made turns based on the black stripe path)
- Programmed microphone on PIC32 microcontroller board to start robot on two claps within a second
- Enabled Output Compare (OC) modules in PWM mode to control the servo motors
